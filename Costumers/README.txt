This is only the Web Api with the Database project.

You just have to open the solution called "Costumers.sln" and press IIS Express in order to run the Web Api.

To Check how it works you could use an application called Postman where you can test the differents http method (Delete, Get, Post.)


PD:

The Angular is in the solution called  "Prueba Tecnica", but I did not have time to finish that part, I tried to use the Net Core scheme but when I tried to display the list,
I got an error about CORS [ has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.] so I could not find the solution but
I going to been looking for that until I get an answer.
